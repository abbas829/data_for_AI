    "Use Lasso when:\n",
    "1.  **High Dimensionality**: You have a huge number of features (e.g., 100+) but you suspect only a few (e.g., 5-10) are actually important.\n",
    "2.  **Multicollinearity**: If features are highly correlated, Lasso will pick one and zero out the others, helping you find the \"representative\" variable.\n",
    "3.  **Need for Interpretability**: If you need to tell your boss *exactly* which factors affect sales, Lasso helps by removing the clutter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔴 Why to use Lasso?\n",
    "1.  **Simplicity**: It creates \"Parsimonious\" models—models that do a lot with very little data.\n",
    "2.  **Automatic Selection**: It removes the need for manual feature selection (like checking correlation heatmaps endlessly).\n",
    "3.  **Prevents Overfitting**: By penalizing large weights, it ensures the model doesn't \"memorize\" the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🗺️ Where to use Lasso?\n",
    "1.  **Genomics**: Identifying which few genes (out of thousands) cause a specific disease.\n",
    "2.  **Marketing**: Figuring out which 2 or 3 ad campaigns (out of 50) actually drove traffic.\n",
